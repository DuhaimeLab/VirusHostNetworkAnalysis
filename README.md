## Virus-Host Network Analysis

Take the output of VHIP 2.0 and do analyses and data visualization, including matrix analysis, network visualization, and network properties calculations. VHIP is an algorithm that predicts the interactions between virus and host pairs.

- Input: Results from VHIP
- Output: Network visualization, matrix, and calculations

Example datasets can be found in the Sample_Input folder. There is also a tutorial caled VHIP_network_tutorial.ipynb, which utilizes the Aug4_predictions.tsv dataset.
